# Dafny for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds _Dafny 3_ support to Visual Studio Code. If you require _Dafny 2_ support, consider using the [legacy extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=correctnessLab.dafny-vscode-legacy).
This VSCode plugin requires the Dafny language server (shipped with the Dafny release since v3.1.0). The plugin will install it automatically upon first use.

## Features

- **Compile and Run** `.dfy` files.
- **Verification** as one types.
- **Syntax highlighting** thanks to [sublime-dafny](https://github.com/erggo/sublime-dafny). See file `LICENSE_sublime-dafny.rst` for license.
- Display **counterexample** for failing proof.
- **IntelliSense** to suggest symbols.
- **Go to definition** to quickly navigate.
- **Hover Information** for symbols.

You can find [examples below](#examples).

## Requirements

The plugin requires at least .NET Core 5.0 (the ASP.NET Core 5.0 or 6.0 runtimes to be more specific) to run the _Dafny Language Server_. Please download a distribution from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
When you first open a _Dafny_ file, the extension will prompt you to install .NET Core manually. The language server gets installed automatically.

Please note that in this new plugin version "automatic verification" is always on and a language server side feature.

## Examples

Here are a few impressions of the features.

### Installation

On the first start, the plugin will install the _Dafny_ language server automatically.

### Automatic Verification

If VSCode appears unresponsive, you may lower the verification frequency or disable it entirely.

## Troubleshooting

### Stuck at *Verifying...*

Under certain circumstances, the extension appears to be stuck at *Verifying...*. Until now, this has only been observed for Mac OSX and occurs due to a [stack overflow](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1213#issuecomment-870440082) in the language server.
To overcome this issue, set the environment variable `COMPlus_DefaultStackSize` to a sufficiently large value before starting VSCode. For example:

```sh
# Increase the stack size
export COMPlus_DefaultStackSize=100000

# Launch VSCode
code
```

## Contribute

Dafny for Visual Studio Code is an MIT licensed open-source project that lives from code contributions.

We welcome your help! For a description of how you can contribute, as well as a list of issues you can work on, please visit the [Dafny-VSCode GitHub repository](https://github.com/DafnyVSCode/ide-vscode).

### Building Locally

To build Dafny VSCode locally, first clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dafny-lang/ide-vscode.git
```

Change into the root directory of the previously cloned repository and install the node modules.

```sh
npm install
```

To build and debug using Visual Studio Code, install the [TypeScript + Webpack Problem Matchers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.tsl-problem-matcher) extension.
After the installation, open the root folder within VSCode and hit `F5` to debug the Dafny extension.

Because the latest version of the plugin requires recent changes to the Dafny language server, you will then need to change the `dafny.compilerRuntimePath` and `dafny.languageServerRuntimePath` extension settings to point to the `Dafny.dll` and `DafnyLanguageServer.dll` files from a local build of Dafny. See [here](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL#building-and-developing-from-source-code) for instructions on building Dafny locally.

### Packaging

To create a VSIX package of the previously built sources, create the package through the CLI:

```sh
npx vsce package
```

### Coding Conventions

We use ESLint with the TypeScript plugin to ensure code consistency across the whole source. Install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension in VSCode to have live feedback. Alternatively, you can check your code from the command line by running `npm run lint`.
