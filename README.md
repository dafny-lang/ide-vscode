## Features

- **Compile and Run** `.dfy` files.
- **Verification** as one types.
- **Syntax highlighting** thanks to [sublime-dafny](https://github.com/erggo/sublime-dafny). See file `LICENSE_sublime-dafny.rst` for license.
- Display **counterexample** for failing proof.
- **IntelliSense** to suggest symbols.
- **Go to definition** to quickly navigate.
- **Hover Information** for symbols.

You can find [examples below](#examples).

## Requirements

The plugin requires at least .NET Core 5.0 (the ASP.NET Core 5.0 or 6.0 runtimes to be more specific) to run the _Dafny Language Server_. Please download a distribution from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
When you first open a _Dafny_ file, the extension will prompt you to install .NET Core manually. The language server gets installed automatically.

## Examples

Here are a few impressions of the features.

### Installation

On the first start, the plugin will install the _Dafny_ language server automatically.

### Error Highlighting

![Syntax](readmeResources/Syntax.png)

Whenever a syntax, semantic, or verification error is present, the plugin will inform the user.

### Compile and Run

Press `F5` to compile and run the program.

### Show Counterxamples

Press `F7` to show counterexamples.

### Hover Information

Hover a symbol to get information about that symbol.

### IntelliSense

Type a dot to get a list of possible members of the accessed symbol.

### Automatic Verification

If VSCode appears unresponsive, you may lower the verification frequency or disable it entirely.

## Troubleshooting

### Stuck at *Verifying...*

Under certain circumstances, the extension appears to be stuck at *Verifying...*. Until now, this has only been observed for Mac OSX and occurs due to a [stack overflow](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1213#issuecomment-870440082) in the language server.
To overcome this issue, set the environment variable `COMPlus_DefaultStackSize` to a sufficiently large value before starting VSCode. For example:

```sh
# Increase the stack size
export COMPlus_DefaultStackSize=100000

# Launch VSCode
code
```

## Contribute

Dafny for Visual Studio Code is an MIT licensed open-source project that lives from code contributions.

We welcome your help! For a description of how you can contribute, as well as a list of issues you can work on, please visit the [Dafny-VSCode GitHub repository](https://github.com/DafnyVSCode/ide-vscode).

### Building Locally

To build Dafny VSCode locally, first clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dafny-lang/ide-vscode.git
```

Change into the root directory of the previously cloned repository and install the node modules.

```sh
npm install
```

To build and debug using Visual Studio Code, install the [TypeScript + Webpack Problem Matchers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.tsl-problem-matcher) extension.
After the installation, open the root folder within VSCode and hit `F5` to debug the Dafny extension.

Because the latest version of the plugin requires recent changes to the Dafny language server, you will then need to change the `dafny.compilerRuntimePath` and `dafny.languageServerRuntimePath` extension settings to point to the `Dafny.dll` and `DafnyLanguageServer.dll` files from a local build of Dafny. See [here](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL#building-and-developing-from-source-code) for instructions on building Dafny locally.

### Packaging

To create a VSIX package of the previously built sources, create the package through the CLI:

```sh
npx vsce package
```

### Coding Conventions

We use ESLint with the TypeScript plugin to ensure code consistency across the whole source. Install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension in VSCode to have live feedback. Alternatively, you can check your code from the command line by running `npm run lint`.
